1- Open the terminal in the directory you want to create a virtual environment in.
2- Type: py -m venv <name_of_your_environment>
3- Type: <name_of_your_environment>\Scripts\activate.bat

Once that done, anytime you will open the terminal the environment will be activated, if not activate it using command 3.

Now, you can install any library you want, and it will be exclusively used in this project and will not conflict with the global interpreter.

**Note**

Always use this to update pip, it's not necessary but nice.
py -m pip install --upgrade pip
