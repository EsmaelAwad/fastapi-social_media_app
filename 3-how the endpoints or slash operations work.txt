if you define the app and want to define an api endpoint, for example, a link that directs the user to the login portal:

@app.get('/login'):
def login():
	return {'anything you want the user to see when they login'}

let's say someone want to get all the users posts:

dummy_users_posts = [
    "Like, FR, Why is pizza at this place so damn expensive? It's not even that good",
    "Bro's hit the rock bottom",
    "I need to get married",
    "This is too personal, I don't like the way my data is used!"
]

@app.get('/posts')
def get_posts():
    return {
            "Posts": {user:post for user,post in enumerate(dummy_users_posts)}
    }

This means you will need to type the root/posts
and they will see the following:
{
    "Posts": {
        "0": "Like, FR, Why is pizza at this place so damn expensive? It's not even that good",
        "1": "Bro's hit the rock bottom",
        "2": "I need to get married",
        "3": "This is too personal, I don't like the way my data is used!"
    }
}


**IMPORTANT NOTE**

FastAPI searches for the endpoits or the slashes in the order they are written to not run the entire program for no reason.
it searches by two keys: 1- the endpoin (/login); If it finds two login endpoints it looks for: 2- the type of http request (get,post....etc) if the two login endpoints are the same http request type, it just picks the first one.


** IMPORTANT NOTE**
When you want to create an end point, you have to name it in plural, like this:
/post/... X
/posts/... Correct
/user/... X
/users/... Correct
